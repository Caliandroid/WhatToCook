My private project KOCHPLANER (engl. cooking planer): 

One-click android app that helps me 

- record and save all of my favorite recipes (including csv in- and export as well as taking pictures of cookbook receipts)
- to plan my cooking week and the grocery shopping for it
- Including rules like 1x fish, 2x meat, 4x vegetarian, seasonal receips according to the current date, frequency (favorite dishes more often but not every week...) as well as some random receipt-picking voodo. 

What you still got to do: Record your favorite receipts including the ingredients (for grocery list). 

The app is in a very early state and only with german interface but already functional.

If you want to test it, please send me a messsage.
